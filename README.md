# Book-of-R
Repository containing the scripts I write as I work through *The Book of R* by Tilman A. Davies, No Starch Press, 2016.

I didn't save many of the scripts from the first several chapters, and some that I did were poorly documented. Later chapters include as comments the prompts and instructions.
